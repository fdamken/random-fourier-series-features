We noticed a major influence of the half-period during hyper-parameter optimization using Optuna\cite{akibaOptunaNextgenerationHyperparameter2019}.
That is, the higher the (initial) value of \(\tilde{T}\), the higher the objective (see \cref{fig:optunaParallelCoordinates}).
As a consequence we included the half-period into the set of (hyper-) parameter that are optimized using empirical Bayes, however, this phenomenon is still in place.
This is also reflected in Optuna's importance rating of \num{0.86}.

		Parallel coordinates plot of the hyper-parameter's values connecting specific Optuna\cite{akibaOptunaNextgenerationHyperparameter2019} trials.
		It can be seen that the half-period value has a major influence on the object (leftmost axis).
		Trial was run on the UCI\cite{duaUCIMachineLearning2017} Boston Housing data set with random \ac{RFSF} initialization.
		Objective is the negative log-likelihood on the test data.
